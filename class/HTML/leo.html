<p>Lokesh Kanagaraj, collaborating with Vijay for the second time in 'Leo,' has unveiled intriguing insights about the action drama's hidden elements. Despite facing time constraints, Kanagaraj had initially intended Leo Das's confrontation with a pack of wolves as an introductory sequence to define his character, but this idea was ultimately discarded.
